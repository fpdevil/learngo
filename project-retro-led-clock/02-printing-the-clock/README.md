# GOAL 2: Printing the Clock

The goal here is to print the led digits along with proper separators and display them to the terminal. We will use the `time` package and get the formatted time to display digits aligning to the current system time.

## Steps followed as per the course.

As per the course guidelines, here are the pointers followed to achieve the goal.

1. Get the current time

2. Get the current hour, minute and second from the current time

3. Create the clock array by getting the digits from the digits array

4. Print the clock by using the clock array

5. Create a separator array (it's also a placeholder type)

6. Add the separators into the correct positions of the clock array

## Output from the code run.

Finally, here is the output of the code run.

```bash
